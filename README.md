### Planned Cloud Integration
- **AWS Lambda deployment** for serverless operation
- **CloudWatch integration** for centralized logging and alerting
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing and deployment

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` installed (comes with Python)

---


### Installation

Clone and install in editable mode:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/rdaneel-ali/python-health-monitor.git
cd python-health-monitor

# Install the project and its dependencies
# The `-e` flag installs in editable mode for development
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively install directly from GitHub without cloning

```bash
# Install the latest version from the main branch
pip install git+https://github.com/rdaneel-ali/python-health-monitor.git

# Or install a specific release/tag
pip install git+https://github.com/rdaneel-ali/python-health-monitor.git@v0.1.0
```

### Quick Start üöÄ
The project includes a **default configuration** (`config/config.yaml`) so you can run it immediately after installation.

```bash
# Run the monitor with the included default config
python-health-monitor
```
**Example Output:**
```bash
Loaded configuration from config/config.yaml
Logging configured: logs/health_monitor.log at INFO level
Starting health checks...
Dummy API: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Success: 200

Health check summary: 1/1 endpoints healthy
üéâ All endpoints are healthy!
Health checks completed
```
**Custom Configuration file**
To run with your own configuration, provide a file via `--config`:
```bash
python-health-monitor --config /path/to/my/config.yaml
```
### Dependencies

**Core Application:**
- `requests` - HTTP client for health checks
- `PyYAML` - Configuration file parsing

**Testing & Quality:**
- `pytest` - Testing framework

**AWS & LocalStack Integration:**
- `boto3` - AWS SDK for Python
- `awscli-local` - LocalStack-compatible AWS CLI wrapper
- `localstack-client` - LocalStack service management

> All AWS-related dependencies work seamlessly with LocalStack for local development

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with the default configuration
python-health-monitor

# Run with a custom configuration file
python-health-monitor --config /path/to/my/config.yaml

# Show help for command-line options
python-health-monitor --help
```

### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
The monitor is **configuration-driven**, so you can adjust behavior without modifying code.

**Default Configuration**
The tool loads `config/config.yaml` by default

```yaml
# config/config.yaml
# A simple, single-source-of-truth configuration file.
monitor:
  timeout: 5        # Request timeout in seconds
  retries: 3        # Number of retry attempts

logging:
  file: "logs/health_monitor.log"
  level: "INFO"

endpoints:
  - name: "Python.org"
    url: "https://python.org"
  - name: "Example Site"
    url: "https://example.com"
  - name: "Google"
    url: "https://google.com"
```
This file is ready to use immediately ‚Äî no changes required.

**Custom Configuration**
You can create your own YAML or JSON file and pass it with `--config`:

```bash
python-health-monitor --config /path/to/my/config.yaml
```

Example custom file:
```yaml
monitor:
  timeout: 10
  retries: 5

logging:
  file: "logs/prod_monitor.log"
  level: "WARNING"

endpoints:
  - name: "Production API"
    url: "https://api.example.com/health"
  - name: "Docs"
    url: "https://docs.example.com"
```

### Environment Overrides
Environment variables override config file values (useful in CI/CD or Docker)

```bash
export MONITOR_TIMEOUT=15
export MONITOR_RETRIES=2
python-health-monitor
```


### Working Example ‚úÖ
Here's how to verify the monitor works in your system:

- **1. Clone & install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdaneel-ali/python-health-monitor.git
cd python-health-monitor
pip install -e .
```

- **2. Run with default config**

  ```bash
  python-health-monitor
  ```

  Example output

  ```bash
  [INFO] Checking endpoint: Python.org (https://python.org)
  [INFO] Endpoint 'Python.org' is healthy (200)
  [INFO] Checking endpoint: Example Site (https://example.com)
  [INFO] Endpoint 'Example Site' is healthy (200)
  [INFO] Checking endpoint: Google (https://google.com)
  [INFO] Endpoint 'Google' is healthy (200)
  ```
  Logs are also written to `logs/health_monitor.log`.

- **3. Create a custom config**

  Save as `config/custom.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  monitor:
    timeout: 3
    retries: 2

  logging:
    file: "logs/custom_monitor.log"
    level: "DEBUG"

  endpoints:
    - name: "Google"
      url: "https://google.com"
    - name: "Broken API"
      url: "https://httpbin.org/status/500"
  ```

- **4. Run with custom config**

  ```bash 
    python-health-monitor --config config/custom.yaml
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
    [INFO] Checking endpoint: Google (https://www.google.com)
    [INFO] Endpoint 'Google' is healthy (200)
    [WARNING] Endpoint 'Broken API' returned status 500
  ```

## Architecture

### Design Principles

**Configuration-Driven Design**
- Externalized settings in YAML for flexibility without code changes
- Environment-specific configs (development, staging, production)

**Resilience Patterns**
- Retry logic with configurable attempts and delays
- Timeout handling to prevent hanging requests
- Graceful degradation when endpoints fail

**Observability**
- Structured logging with multiple severity levels
- File and console output for different use cases
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

**Modularity**
- Single-responsibility functions for testability
- Clear separation between configuration, execution, and reporting
- Type hints for code clarity and IDE support

### Error Handling Strategy

The script handles network failures gracefully:
- **Timeout errors**: Server too slow to respond
- **Connection errors**: DNS/network issues
- **HTTP errors**: Unexpected status codes
- **Configuration errors**: Missing/invalid YAML files

Each error type is logged with specific context for debugging.

## Development

### IDE Setup

This project includes VS Code configuration for streamlined development:

```json
// .vscode/launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: Local Debug",
      "type": "debugpy",
      "request": "launch",

        "LOCALSTACK_HOST": "localhost",
        "EDGE_PORT": "4566"
      }
    }
